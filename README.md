```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to access the interface.

## Models Included
This repository includes several predictive models:

### 1. LightGBM
LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms. It is efficient for large datasets and provides high performance.

### 2. LSTM
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) suitable for time series forecasting. They can capture long-term dependencies in data.

### 3. Random Forest
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and merges them for more accurate predictions.

### 4. XGBoost
XGBoost is another gradient boosting framework known for its speed and performance. It is widely used in machine learning competitions.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning is crucial for improving model performance. This project implements techniques such as Grid Search and Random Search to find the best parameters for each model. 

You can customize the tuning process in the `hyperparameter_tuning.py` file. Adjust the parameters and rerun the script to optimize your models.

## Streamlit Interface
The Streamlit interface allows users to interact with the prediction models easily. You can upload your dataset, select the model, and visualize the results in real-time.

### Key Features of the Interface
- **Upload Data**: Easily upload CSV files containing electricity consumption data.
- **Select Model**: Choose from various models for prediction.
- **Visualizations**: View graphs and charts to analyze predictions and trends.
